# W3PN Projects

This repository serves as a registry of top-tier projects of [Web3Privacy Now](https://web3privacy.info/) initiative.

Each our top-tier project has its own [Issue](https://github.com/web3privacy/projects/issues) in this repository and are displayed in the GitHub Project [W3PN Projects](https://github.com/orgs/web3privacy/projects/12).

If you have an idea for a new top-tier project, we'd love it if you [create a new issue](https://github.com/web3privacy/projects/issues/new) and let us know!
